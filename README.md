# Linear_power_supply
- Four members of our group collaborated to develop a linear power supply design aimed at providing a consistent voltage and current output. The design process commences with a step-down transformer tasked with reducing the input voltage from 230V to 15V AC. Subsequently, a GBPC3506W bridge rectifier is employed to convert this AC voltage into DC, followed by a 10mF capacitor to smoothen the output.
- Our design integrates two transistors, specifically the MJ4502 and BC547A, configured as a Sziklai pair, along with a 10V Zener diode, a 150â„¦ resistor, and a diode to regulate voltage. We've also implemented current limiting to cap the maximum current at 10A, and there's built-in short-circuit protection for safety measures. To ensure effective heat dissipation, we've utilized a heat sink in conjunction with the MJ4502 transistor and bridge rectifier.
- The final product consists of a single-layer PCB enclosed within a 3D-printed casing, and we've incorporated a 12V DC fan to facilitate cooling.
- The main function of the linear power supply is to drive a load under constant voltage/current condition. Under this project we design a 10V linear power supply with a maximum current rating of 10A with the voltage regulator from scratch to drive a high-power load (100W) from 230V input voltage. The final circuit is made of two circuits. They are main regulation circuit and protection circuit.
